### Notes
- [x] Build'24 Questions #sentral #task ðŸ“… 2024-06-11 âœ… 2024-06-11
	- When is AKS Automatic coming out of Preview?
		- Have reached out to PG, will share more on this. 
	- Specific changes for MySQL?
		- Sorry for MySQL content being overridden previously. Key announcements:  
		  (a) you can now build RAG apps with AOAI and MySQL with Azure AI Search, 
		  (b) Improvements in Azure MySQL - Business Continuity tier - accelerated logs (write heavy workloads) and upto 32TB capacity 
		  (c) On-demand backup and Export feature enhances redundancy, recovery, auditing capabilities. 
		  Please check out https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql-blog/build-2024-unveiling-performance-and-ai-innovations-in-azure/ba-p/4146408. 
	- Fabric Real Time Analytics vs saying PBI Direct Query?
		- At an higher level, with Fabric RT, you could expect streaming ingestion, indexing, time and hash-based data partitioning, and support for structured, semi-structured, and free text data. They are also different in ways that your questions to RT could change frequently, whereas Direct Query is still mostly backing a set report, albeit as a query which could have network and capacity limits. Happy to go deeper on this as its a good topic to touch upon. 
	- AKS Automatic allowing self-serve?
		- In short, yes. Whilst the service is not pitched or positioned as self-serve (say, e.g. compared to Power BI) - with integrated safeguards and access controls you could enable (selected / all) Dev's for self serve. Please reference https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-aks-automatic and AKS Engg blog (https://azure.github.io/AKS/2024/05/22/aks-automatic) for more on this.
