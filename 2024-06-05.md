	- Copilot Connectors â€“ would it be directly connected to services? 
		- Basically what Copilot Connectors in Copilot Studio does is it brings MSFT Graph, Power Platform connectors to Copilot Studio. Post that sourced data can be grounded and be further used for intelligent Q&A, actions etc. More details can be referenced at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/copilot-connectors-in-copilot-studio. 
	- AKS Automatic: How the journey looks like for current AKS customers?
		- There's no built-in migration feature supporting AKS to AKS Automatic today, but workloads can be reprovisioned in target environment (post AKS Automatic deployment) using CI/CD. There are some baseline variations in terms of OS, Network, Security etc. which can be referenced at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-aks-automatic. 
	- Advanced Observability on Kubernetes Networking? (ETA)
		- I can see this feature on internal boards, but ETA is not called out as yet. I have reached out internally and will share more on this. 
		- [ ] Asked Nate Ceres and Aritra Ghosh #prospa #track ðŸ“… 2024-06-12
