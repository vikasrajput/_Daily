## Notes
- Sentral Fabric Workshop 
	- Notes from Fabric 
		- Data Engg, Data Warehosue, Data Science, Power BI 
		- Data Analytics 
	- Angle 1: Current solution 
		- solving problem without any strategy. Fire-fight most of the time. We create semantic model on the go - here's a problem fix it today, and go from there. Huge lack of control of data. Turns into different beast as we grow. 
			- In our power BI workspace, we have 20 something models but they are inter-twined. meaning more time needed from john - business users cant be self-served today. 
	- Angle 2: If ideal state is reached, can Sentral be able to make more money? 
		- Potentially yes. We collect data, and not process or insight on it. Product development can be enabled. 
	- Open items to follow up 
		- Spend on PBI today vs Fabric 
		- How is current PBI license setup is 
		- John have  a strategy check in with Ant tomorrow
